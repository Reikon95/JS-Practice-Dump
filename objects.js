// The object that a method belongs to is called the calling object.
// The this keyword refers the calling object and can be used to access properties of the calling object.
// Methods do not automatically have access to other internal properties of the calling object.
// The value of this depends on where the this is being accessed from.
// We cannot use arrow functions as methods if we want to access other internal properties.
// JavaScript objects do not have built-in privacy, rather there are conventions to follow to notify other developers about the intent of the code.
// The usage of an underscore before a property name means that the original developer did not intend for that property to be directly changed.
// Setters and getter methods allow for more detailed ways of accessing and assigning properties.
// Factory functions allow us to create object instances quickly and repeatedly.
// There are different ways to use object destructuring: one way is the property value shorthand and another is destructured assignment.
// As with any concept, it is a good skill to learn how to use the documentation with objects!
// Youâ€™re ready to start leveraging more elegant code for creating and accessing objects in your code!
